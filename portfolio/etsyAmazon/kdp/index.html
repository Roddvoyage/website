    <p>In the screenshots below you will be able to see the platform I use for creating, editing and uploading my books on Amazon. In the links you will be directed to the items page of some of the books that appear in the screenshots. Amazon does not give me the option to showcase my whole inventory in the same page, so the only way for me to showcase my items is by sending the links of each one individually.</p>
