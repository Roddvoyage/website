    <p>Below you will not only find the link to my Etsy store but also a screenshot of my Etsy seller account. Just like on Amazon, I have been also selling on Etsy since 2017. Also, do not mind the fact that the owner of the store is a woman called Emma. I did not want to expose my identity and I did not have to, I just needed a name and picture and I opted for a fake person. The reason why I chose a woman is because I read in a forum that female sellers usually get less bad reviews, and I can testify that people on Etsy are indeed more benevolent that customers on Amazon. Maybe just a coincidence...</p>
