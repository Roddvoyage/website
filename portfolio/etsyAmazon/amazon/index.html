    <p>My Amazon account is currently is suspended and this is due to not updating my tax documentation. I do not intend to update it in the near future due to the fact that a lot of rules have changed in Amazon that have made being an Amazon seller not as good or rewarding as it once was. It used to be my main source of income but now it requires too much work for too little profit. Because of that reason I am not able to present part of the information regarding my history as a seller on Amazon but I am still able to showcase my inventory and all information regarding it. In the screenshots below you will be able to see the number of items I was selling, the latest item I uploaded and the first one, the date of when I uploaded each one and the items page on Amazon. As you can see, I started selling on Amazon in 2017 and the last item I uploaded was in 2022. I sold on Amazon for 5 years and was a succesful business owner but since Covid a lot of things have changed and this is not my main source of income anymore. Any questions you want answered regarding my experience selling on Amazon, I am more than opened to answer.</p>
